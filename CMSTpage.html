              <h2>❌ Struggling with Marketing? We Get It!</h2>

            <p>Running a small business isn't just a job—it's a whirlwind. One moment, you're closing a sale, the next, you're handling customer queries, managing inventory, and maybe even balancing the books. And then there's marketing—arguably the most crucial yet most overwhelming part.</p>
            
            <ul class="animate__animated animate__fadeIn">
                <li>👉 Who has the time? Between running your business and keeping customers happy, squeezing in hours for content creation feels impossible.</li>
                <li>👉 It's expensive. Hiring a designer, social media manager, or marketing agency isn't exactly pocket-friendly.</li>
                <li>👉 It's complicated. There are way too many tools out there—Photoshop, Canva, Instagram Ads, email marketing, SEO.</li>
                <li>👉 Inconsistent branding slows you down. Without a clear, professional brand identity, businesses struggle to build trust.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The truth? Small businesses deserve marketing that works—without the stress, confusion, or hefty price tag. And that's exactly where CreatiMate comes in. 🚀</p>
